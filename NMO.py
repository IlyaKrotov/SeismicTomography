def nmo_correction(cmp, dt, offsets, velocities):

        Parameters
        ----------
        
        cmp : 2D array
        The CMP gather that we want to correct.
        dt : float
        The sampling interval.
        offsets : 1D array
        An array with the offset of each trace in the CMP.
        velocities : 1D array
        An array with the NMO velocity for each time. Should
        have the same number of elements as the CMP has samples.
